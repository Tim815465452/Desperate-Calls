Don't want to keep on pretending positive
Why people feel being negetive & being evil so easy, but being positive & being kind so hard? That's because people are animals in the same degree, feeling comfortable in the own community or social atmosphere is still their initial consideration. Being defensive to the outside as indibidual & being offensive to the outside as a group are one of the best ways for them to make themselves comfortable & feeling in secure.
