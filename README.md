# Desperate-Calls
Private words during low time, some might be meaningless, but a true profile of my life with no expectation.

Usually I would use English to express my minds, but sometimes with the intention of letting someone to know or read I would choose Chinese.

If someday I've been gone, I hope some of my friend would translate it into Chinese for my mother's convinience to read. Truly thanks.


I have been diagnosed as Depressive disorder since 2018, and have been taking medicine since then. Got hospitalized under doctors' suggestion twice in 2021, and diagnosed as MDD, during the second time in hostipal went throught several MECT therapy(Maybe in March-April). And the take a year off from school since my memories problems after the therapy. Although I'm a sophomore student in English major in China and have been learning German for about a year, I have difficulties in spelling basic English words and lost almost all German progress I had made till today as side effects of the therapy. Learning new things is almost impossible for me as I can't remember/memorize things systematically, recalling things is not feasible to me. Most thing happened in the past needs waiting till it poops out and to get memorized again for another recall, and memories can't stay long for me. I can easily forget videos I watch last week and noticed I watched it after rewatching it again. A lot of memories had been lost to me. I only have a little profile of my past 20 years. And the memory problem haven't been better these two months.
