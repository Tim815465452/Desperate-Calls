# Desperate-Calls
Private words during low time, some might be meaningless, but a true profile of my life with no expectation.

Usually I would use English to express my minds, but sometimes with the intention of letting someone to know or read I would choose Chinese.

If someday I've been gone, I hope some of my friend would translate it into Chinese for my mother's convinience to read. Truly thanks.
