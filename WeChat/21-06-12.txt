I feel there should be three phases.

The first would be feel like
"I'm losing the world.",
which I don't know when exactly did it start, maybe from primary grade 6.

The second would be feel like
"I'm losing.",
which again I don't know when did it start.
But I can sure that it should not be later than the time I got senior grade 3.

The third should be what I had been going through, that "The world is losing me".
Incredibly, this is the only phase I know and remember when did it occur to me, at least for one time, 6th December last year.

I don't think it would be any obvious boundaries between these phases. But I do know how I acted differently in different phases. 
The first feels normal, like nothing special needs to be done.
The second makes me a little bit scared, wondering reaching for help.
Maybe ironically but true, phase three makes me brave, daring to do things I would have not dare to do or challenge. As if there wouldn't be another chance.

For now, I don't know where am I among these phases. All I know is I've been to all these three phases. I don't know if it is an one way route or  I could bounce among any of three. Or maybe I already out of them.

Above all, there's one thing I'm sure about: My world have been shrinking for long. And I have no hope in bring it back for I felt used to it for years.
