One year ago,
I,
step onto an unknown path,
then my life has changed.

It,
like ink into the water,
like viruses into the cell,
spreading unstopped.

I,
resisting the truth,
which you pitched,
but fell in vain.

You,
let me aside,
let me down.

We,
try our less,
to hurt the best.

Now,
banishing each other,
like nothing happened,
we're good.
We're great.
