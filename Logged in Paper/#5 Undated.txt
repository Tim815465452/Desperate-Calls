	I think things have come to a point where no more optimistic changes can be actually done.
	My emotion keeps on being vulnerable. Up and down. I hate that. I'm far from too sensitive.[03-08-2021 Hant注：我遠不只是過度敏感 EngNote:I'm far 'more' than too sensitive] I can't see hope of the depressing feeling going away. They might be less, but still there. I often fall into periods of lack of concertration.
	
	And one of the worst thing I found, that I'm kind of being not like me sometimes since I increased the dose I take recently according to what Dr told me to do. I'm sometimes over optimistic and too passionate in sth. Something with some irrational words automatically and some impulsive desitions appeared. And it makes me much more regret afterwards.
	
	I'm sometime a cynic, but I prefer that for I think it can protect me from making decisions that might hurt myself. I'll be sometime optimistic or positive to almost everything, but usually would not come with good results.
	
	I once thought that I got the chance of finding someone can develop an intimate relation with me. But for now, that thought is too optimistic. First, I comepeletely have no idea of wherther he is gay or bisexual. Second, I don't think my current unsteably condition is suitable for me to add another people into my inner social ring. Third, I don't think it's going to last long & I would be hurt harder after it.
	
	I want sb. to burden my sorrow and pain, but first, I don't want to bother anyone.
