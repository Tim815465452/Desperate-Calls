Sad Frustrated 
Hopeless Powerless 
Life out of control 
Feeling all this feeling ruin my ration ruin my life my future

Don¡¯t want to continue but don¡¯t want to die mostly because its impact on others

Don¡¯t want to care so much about others
Sometimes want to live myself
But that¡¯s exactly why I didn¡¯t/haven¡¯t die

I want there be an accident that I don¡¯t need to take that responsibility.

Don¡¯t want to take more medicines. I already compromise to take some to change myself to this day. I¡¯m already feeling I¡¯m not myself.
More? I don¡¯t think it can solve the problem.
	Or say, I¡¯m already think it¡¯s rooted in me. Maybe erasing it is also erasing me.

Almost impossible to find a one who would like to listen. How dare I expect one would know or even understand.

I want to go somewhere else, but nowhere I want to go. [06-08-2021 EngNote: I want to go nowhere./There¡¯s nowhere I want to go]
